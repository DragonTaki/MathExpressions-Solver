/**
 * @file RoundRecord.h
 * @brief Defines the data structure for recording a single round's player input
 *        and corresponding feedback state within the expression-solving game.
 *
 * <summary>
 * Each round of gameplay involves a player's attempted expression (e.g., `"12+3*4"`)
 * and the color-coded feedback that indicates correctness or positional accuracy,
 * similar to games like Wordle.  
 *
 * The `RoundRecord` structure encapsulates these two key pieces of data:
 * - The **raw input expression** entered by the player.
 * - The **color feedback string**, where each color represents match state
 *   (`'g'` for correct position, `'y'` for wrong position but correct symbol,
 *   `'r'` for incorrect symbol, etc.).
 *
 * Instances of this struct are typically stored in a history container (e.g., `std::vector<RoundRecord>`)
 * to represent the sequence of attempts made by a player throughout a game session.
 * </summary>
