/**
 * @class LogFileManager
 * @brief Thread-safe logging utility for writing messages to a file.
 *
 * <summary>
 * LogFileManager provides a static, globally accessible mechanism for safely managing
 * application log output. It handles file initialization, writing, and cleanup,
 * ensuring thread-safe access using a mutex lock.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Thread-safe file writes
 * - Automatic session headers and footers with timestamps
 * - Silent mode for disabling file output (useful for testing)
 * - Static-only design (cannot be instantiated)
 * </summary>
 *
 * <remarks>
 * This class is fully static â€” it cannot be instantiated or copied.
 * All operations are protected by an internal mutex (`mutex_`), ensuring
 * that concurrent log writes from multiple threads do not conflict.
 *
 * The class writes session metadata when the log starts and ends, including timestamps.
 * If `Initialize()` fails, all subsequent write operations will print a warning to `std::cerr`.
 * </remarks>
 *
 * <example>
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * LogFileManager::Initialize("app.log");          // Open or create a log file
 * LogFileManager::Write("Application started.");  // Write a log message
 * LogFileManager::Shutdown();                     // Close and finalize the log session
 * @endcode
 * </example>
